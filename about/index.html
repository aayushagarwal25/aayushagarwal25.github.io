			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
        Hey! I'm Aayush. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, USA with my master's and Manipal Institute of Technology, India with my bachelor's. I'm interested in
        computer and network security. My passion for number theory gives rise to following chain of interests: number theory -> cryptography -> computer security in general. 
        I work as a software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
        
        I'm an avid soccer fan and I support Chelsea FC (#KTBFFH). 
        
        In this page you can find various posts about things I like ranging from number theory to computer security to random stuff.
        
        You can optionally insert a brief bio here. You went to this school, you studied that, you now work in this field with research interests in that subject.
        At your previous position at this place, you worked on this or that. You can list some of your significant accomplishments, awards, or recognition here as well.
        You live in this city with these animals and people. In your free time you like X, Y, and Z.
